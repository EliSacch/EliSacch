# Hi there

### My name is Elisa, and I am an aspiring Full Stack Developer.

## About me

I grew up in a small town in Italy, between the mountains and the sea, and i moved to Ireland in 2019.


I love walking, taekwondo, and, as I recently discovered, coding :)


## Career

I started my career in hospitality, fascinated by the opportunity this sector offers to work abroad and get in contact with different cultures.


Here in Ireland, I could experience a stimulating and multicultural environment, and it is here that I discovered the world of coding.


## Studies

My first step towards this new career was to start a course online. This is why I completed 
[The Complete Web Developer Course 2.0](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-course-2/) on Udemy.

It gave me the knowledge to start building my first projects, and I learned the fundamentals of:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- MySql


After 1 year of self-learning, I was feeling that something was missing and that I needed a more structured course. This is why at the end of June 2022 I started my journey with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/global/)


Not only I could refresh my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but I have also learnt the following languages and frameworks:
- Python
- Flask
- PostgreSQL
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- React


But most importantly, it taught me best practices, and it allowed me to start collaborating with other developers.
