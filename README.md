# Hi there

### My name is Elisa, and I am studying to be a web developer.

## About me

I was born in Italy in 1992, and I grew up in a small town between the mountains and the sea.
In 2019 I moved to Ireland, where I now live with my sister.  


I love walking, taekwondo and, as I recently discovered, coding :)


## Career

I started my career in hospitality, fascinated by the opportunity this sector offers to work abroad and live diffent cultures.


Here in Ireland I could experience a stimulating and multicultural evnvironment, and it is here that I discovered the world of coding.

## Studies

My first step towards this new career was to start a course online. This is why I completed 
[The Complete Web Developer Course 2.0](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-course-2/) on Udemy.

It gave me the knowledge to start building my first projects, and I learned the foundamentals of:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- MySql


After 1 year of self learning although, I was feeling that something was missing, and that I needed a more structured course. This is why in the end of June 2022 I started my journey with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/global/)


Not only I could refresh my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but the program includes the folowwing languages and frameworks:
- Python
- Django
- Flask
- React

But more than everything it teaches best practices, and it allows to start collaborating with other developers.

## Completed Projects

Here are some of the most recent projects:

This was my first project for the Code Institute course, and it was built just with HTML and CSS. 

This projects is an important part of my learning, since for the first time I had to write documentation and test my website.

<summary>ScoreTRACKER</summary>

This was my second project for the Code Institute course, and it was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

This second project was so much fun to build, because it is focused on JavaScript.
