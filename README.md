# Hi there

### My name is Elisa, and I am an aspiring Full Stack Software Developer.

## About me

I grew up in a small town in Italy, between the mountains and the sea, and I moved to Ireland in 2019.


I love walking, taekwondo, and, as I recently discovered, coding :)


## Career

I started my career in hospitality, fascinated by the opportunity this sector offers to work abroad and get in contact with different cultures.


Here in Ireland, I could experience a stimulating and multicultural environment, and it is here that I discovered the world of coding.


## Studies

I have completed a Full Stack Software Development Program at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/global/), obtaining a diploma which is university credit-rated by The University of the West of Scotland. Level 8 on the Scottish Qualifications Framework (SCQF). Level 5 on the European Qualification Framework (EQF).


Technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript and JQuery
- Python
- Flask
- PostgreSQL and mySQL
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- React


During my experience I have also learned industries best practices, in regards of accessibility and Agile Development.
I have had also the opportunity to start collaborating.
